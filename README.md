# 🎶 Composer Classification with LSTM 

This project implements a symbolic music classification model to predict classical composers from MIDI files using a bidirectional LSTM neural network. 

-  PyTorch-based LSTM classifier
-  Pitch sequence input from MIDI files
-  Trained on labeled bar-level MIDI segments
-  Gradescope-compatible `predictions1.json` output
