# ðŸŽ¶ Composer Classification with LSTM 

This project implements a symbolic music classification model to predict classical composers from MIDI files using a bidirectional LSTM neural network. 

- âœ… PyTorch-based LSTM classifier
- âœ… Pitch sequence input from MIDI files
- âœ… Trained on labeled bar-level MIDI segments
- âœ… Gradescope-compatible `predictions1.json` output
